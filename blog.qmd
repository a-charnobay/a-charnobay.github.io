Welcome to my blog! I am very happy you are here!

This is a space to talk aboutÂ data - what Iâ€™m learning, what Iâ€™m working on, and all the cool tips, tutorials, and curiosities I come across. It's also a way toÂ document my learning journey, practice writing skills, and share what I findÂ with other learners.

I hope you find something helpful here ðŸ’¡.
