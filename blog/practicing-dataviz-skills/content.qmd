Hi there! Welcome to my very *first blog post* — I’m happy you’re here!

This blog was created as a space to write and share thoughts **about data** — what I’m learning and working on, tutorials, tips, and curiosities. If you’re reading this, it means my attempt to help people on their learning journey has been at least a little successful (and you might even be the very first one!).

Well… since this is my debut as a blogger, I think it’s fair to tell you a bit about how I got here. Not long ago, I was in academia and had just completed a PhD in Soil Science — which, among many things, meant I was surrounded by research data every single day. It was in that environment that I first learned to program using R.

FALAR UM POUCO DE MIM.. DE COMO EU CONHECI E USEI O R.. E DE COMO INFELIZMENTE EU DEMOREI PRA DESCOBRIR A FORCA DA COMUNIDADE R E AS COISAS INCRIVEIS QUE PODEMOS FAZER COM O SOFTWARE (como esse blog por exemplo).

falar do tidytuesday de como eu tenho melhorado minhas habilidades de viz com ele (foto do primeiro e do ultimo viz?)

This brings us to the topic of today's blog. I gathered here some of the greatest initiatives
