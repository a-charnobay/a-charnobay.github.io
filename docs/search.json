    "text": "What Are Data Visualization Challenges?\nData visualization challenges are organized, community-driven initiatives where participants are given a dataset and/or a specific topic or theme to explore. The goal is to practice and improve skills by creating a unique chart, application, or dashboard from the same data and sharing the results online."

    "text": "Why Should You Engage?\nThese challenges are our best friends for practice. They offer a structured, no-pressure way to sharpen three core skills:\n\nData Manipulation: Cleaning and preparing raw data\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Finding the story within the data\n\nVisualization: Bringing that story to life with effective design\n\nBut for me, the real magic lies in the community aspect. Engaging in these challenges means you get to learn from others in two powerful ways:\n\nInspiration: Seeing the diverse and creative ways people approach the same dataset\n\nEducation: Studying their code and techniques to elevate your own skills\n\nSo now that you know what data viz challenges are and why they’re so valuable, the next question is: where do you find them?\nBelow are some of the most popular and beginner-friendly data visualization challenges created by the data community."

    "text": "Making Your Practice Visible\nPracticing data visualization doesn’t have to be a solo journey. Sharing your work is a powerful way to learn, connect, and grow.\nYou can start by posting your visualizations on social media using challenge-specific hashtags like #TidyTuesday, #MakeoverMonday, or #DataViz. Platforms like LinkedIn and X (Twitter) are full of people who enjoy seeing how others explore the same data and often give thoughtful feedback.\nIt’s also worth organizing your projects on GitHub. Creating a repository with your code, data source, and a short explanation of your process turns each challenge into an open portfolio. It shows not just the final chart, but how you got there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow I organize my challenge submissions to TidyTuesday on a GitHub repository\n\n\n\nIt might feel intimidating at first, but the data community is genuinely kind and supportive. Sharing your work is less about being perfect and more about learning together."
