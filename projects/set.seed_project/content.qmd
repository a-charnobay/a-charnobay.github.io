## **About**

set.seed() started from the idea that good science is reproducible science.

In agricultural and environmental research, we work with experiments, data, and decisions that matter. Yet many steps in research and data analysis are still not well documented in a clear or reproducible way.

In R, the set.seed() function ensures that random results can be reproduced. Here, it represents something bigger: an approach to Ag science that is code-driven, transparent, and reliable.

set.seed() is an Instagram-based educational project created to share ideas and content around reproducible science, statistics, programming, and data visualization applied to agriculture and environmental research — especially for graduate students and researchers.
