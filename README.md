## Description

Hi there, and welcome to the repository of my personal website!

This website serves as both my **portfolio** and a place where I share my **learning journey**, projects, and content related to **data science and data visualization**.

The website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
Blog comments are powered by [_giscus_](https://giscus.app/pt), which integrates GitHub Discussions directly into the site.

## Skills

This project has been a hands-on learning experience, helping me strengthen skills including:

- **Quarto** for building reproducible websites and documents  
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** for custom styling  
- **SCSS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)** for more modular and maintainable styles  
- **Markdown** for structured, readable content  
- **Version control with Git** for tracking changes and collaborating
- **Open licensing and content reuse practices** (Creative Commons, attribution, and responsible sharing)

## Resources and inspiration

This website was built with the help of many community resources, including blog posts, tutorials, and open GitHub repositories shared by others.

I learned a lot from these resources and adapted what I found to build something that feels like my own. Any code inspired by others is credited accordingly.
